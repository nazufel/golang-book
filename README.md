# golang-book
This repo is a revisit to the book An Introduction to Programming in Go by Caleb Doxsey found here, https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro. I'll be going through the exercises and pushing the code here.

## Main Func Errors
Technically, should make new repositories for each chapter of this book. Go assumes the whole repo is one project and there should only be one ```func main()```, but I'm lazy and don't want to make a new repository or Go project for each task. Only each ```.go``` as an independent file. For example, in ./chapter4 there are multiple ```.go``` files. You can run each one individually as ```go run temp.go```. Go-plus for Atom will throw errors if there are multiple ```func main()```'s in a single directory. I'm willingly ignoring it and you should do the same.
